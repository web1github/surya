		<h2><u>My self</u></h2>
		<p>I am Budha Magar Surya.I was born in Nepal on June17, 1994. I had a very simple and happy childhood .I am belonging to small, simple and happy family . I have five members in my family. They are Father, Mother, Wife, son and me. My father's name is Bhakta Bahadur Budha and Mother's name is Maya Budha. I studied school from Tri-Jyoty higher secondary school. Thenafter went to Headquater of Rukum district for higher study and I completed bachelor degree from Rukumeli Campus (affilated to Tribhuvan University,Kathmandu Nepal).Now ,I live in Kyoto, Japan for Master degree study.<br>I am an interesting, fun loving guy with a good sense of humor. One thing about me that is important to know though is that at first I come of as a very shy individualistic guy but once I get to know people and are comfortable with my environment I am great. It is hard for me to make friends but once I make them, itâ€™s great and I am all different. I joke, laugh and humor people and I also get as much as I give. I am a very kind, compassionate, sensitive guy as my close friends will tell you. I have a tough shell but on the inside I am soft. I am also a very principled person and stand strong on what is right and wrong. I am also a very straight and honest person.</p>
